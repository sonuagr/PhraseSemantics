# PhraseSemantics
Here we try to get the sematics of phrase using Recursive Neural Networks on the word vectors.
The paper we refer is Semantic Compositionality through Recursive Matrix-Vector Spaces by Richard Socher who has done this work during work his PhD thesis.

Common problems in other methods:
* Represent text in terms of unordered list of words. Sentiments depend not just on the word meanings but how they are ordered
* other
